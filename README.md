Personal Project by [Junwhan Yoo](junwyoo@hotmail.com)

## Core Concepts

1. Memory Safe
2. Strongly and Dynamically Typed
3. Side-effect Free

## Current Functionality

* Garbage Collecting
* Automatic Type Detection

## To be Implemented

* Information Hiding in Struct
* Variable Management System
  * List
* Functional Interface
  * `apply` function
  * First class object

## To be deleted

* Ugly macros
* Ugly naming

## Usage

`startEC` will initialize the library.
`newVar` will create a variable with dynamically allocated memory space. It will grow and be
freed automatically at the end.
